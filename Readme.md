# The Power of Access - CBDC Ramp

## The final step to financial inclusion through DeFi on the XRPL

No counterparty risk, near-zero fees, flexible terms and accessible to everyone - That's what financial inclusion on the XRPL looks like. **On desktop, mobile, as XUMM xApps and in Bifrost's Web3 browser!**

Our new **CBDC Ramp is a completely decentralized way to convert cash into CBDC**, even in regions where the current financial system has not found a way to reach people.

## Inspiration

With DeXfi we offer a DeFi suite that changes the lives of ordinary people. We have brought DeFi to a point where we are able to provide the same financial resources to people all over the world.

Features like

- [x] Provide Liquidity and Earn Fees - **Liquidity (Automated Market Maker)**
- [x] Become a borrower or a lender and earn interest – **P2P Loans (Hooks)**
- [x] Reduce currency risk – **Swap (Auto-Bridging)**
- [x] Profit from trading – **Trade (DEX)**
- [x] Invest in early-stage startups - **Launchpad (Hooks)**
- [x] Secure your livelihood – **P2P Futures Trading (Hooks)**

and many more offer great opportunities to people all over the world.

However, until now this was only accessible to those with a bank account as there was no way for others to start their CBDC journey. Our

### CBDC Ramp – Exchange cash for CBDC (XRPL native, fully decentralized)

is an absolute **game changer** when it comes to **financial inclusion**.

## What it does

It leverages the **decentralized nature of XRPL** and offers anyone, from a **financial institution to businesses and individuals**, the opportunity to become an **Exchange Point**. These allow anyone to **exchange cash for CBDC** and ultimately receive the **same financial opportunities** that are currently reserved for people with a bank account.

Whether a **financial institution charges a fee** or an **individual charges no fee**, our users can see exactly what a particular exchange point offers. With our **Live Currency Calculator** they can instantly see the amount of CBDC they will receive for more than **160 currencies**.

This **decentralized and bottom-up design** not only leads to **wider and faster adoption**, but also promotes **competitive conversion rates**.

Decentralized - Open Source - Fast - Simple - Low Cost - Accessible to everyone

## How we built it

We use a “Map” account, which serves as a **decentralized database** for exchange points.

To become an exchange point, all you have to do is **fill out a short form**, **select your location** on a map and **send a payment** (details are stored in the memo field) to the map-account. This **prevents spam** and keeps **exchange points up to date** as they are automatically removed once the purchased time has expired.

**Users** can easily **search for exchange points** near them, view all the **details such as the exchange fee**, and **instantly calculate** how much CBDC they will **receive for their cash** at a specific exchange point.

## Challenges we ran into

We completely underestimated **how many homes**, especially in Africa and South America, **don't have an actual address** on Google Maps. So we went with **location coordinates and a conversion** to the closest actual address that Google knows.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Together with the XRPL and its outstanding technology, we are now able to not only **empower people to change their lives and the lives of their communities** for the better by providing them with the exact financial services they need, but also **reach People that the current financial system does not reach**.

## What we learned

We learned how important XRPL’s key features – speed, low fees, scalability, etc. – are to bringing such services to the masses. Most importantly, we learned the **impact** a few lines of code can have on people who are **financially underserved**.

## What's next for DeXfi - XRPL DeFi

We are currently in the process of **rebuilding our app from scratch** and will soon be able to offer our services in an app that **looks and feels more like a banking app** than a We3 app. Let's go to even **more and even happier users**!
